## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a
finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that
includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed
code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is
displayed).
